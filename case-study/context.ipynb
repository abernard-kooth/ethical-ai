    "# Case Study Conext\n",
    "In this case study, we describe the use of [The Alan Turing Institute's guide for responsible design and implementation of AI systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf) in the context of a project that classifies mental health content on social media. The project aims to identify patterns and themes related to mental health in social media posts, using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Mental health is a significant public health issue, and social media has become an important platform for people to discuss and seek support. However, the vast amount of mental health-related content on social media can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, making it challenging for individuals and organizations to identify and respond to emerging trends and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we developed a project to analyse and classify mental health content on social media using AI. By identifying patterns and themes in the data, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the mental health experiences and needs of social media users, and to inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "For the project, we used a publicly available social media dataset containing annotated tweets related to mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, called the [Global COVID-19 Twitter dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitashchandra/global-covid19-twitter-dataset), was selected because it provided a large and diverse collection of tweets on mental health, and because the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health globally."
