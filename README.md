# Ethical and Responsible Innovation Guide: Case Study
This repository contains a case study utilising a guide for the responsible design and implementation of AI systems in the public sector, by The Alan Turing Institute's Public Policy Programme.  

## Background
The Alan Turing Institute is a national research institute for data science and artificial intelligence. As the field of AI and data science continues to grow and impact society in new ways, it is important for researchers and practitioners to consider the ethical implications of their work.  

To address this need, the Institute developed a document to provide guidance on ethical considerations for AI and data science innovation.
The guide covers a range of ethical considerations, including:
- **Fairness**: ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases  
- **Transparency**: providing clear and accessible information about how AI systems work and make decisions  
- **Accountability**: establishing clear lines of responsibility and decision-making authority for AI systems  
- **Non-maleficence**: minimizing the potential harm caused by AI systems  
- **Privacy**: protecting personal data and respecting privacy rights  
- **Security**: protecting against unauthorized access or misuse of AI systems  

The guide also provides practical recommendations for addressing these considerations, such as conducting impact assessments, engaging with stakeholders, and implementing effective governance frameworks.  

## Case Study
The case study in this repository documents the use of the ethical and responsible innovation guide at the Institute in the context of a data science project. It covers the following topics:
- [context.ipynb](https://github.com/aynsleybernard/ethical-ai/blob/main/case-study/context.ipynb): context of the project
- [guide_overview.md](https://github.com/aynsleybernard/ethical-ai/blob/main/case-study/guide_overview.md): guide overview for the responsible design and implementation of AI systems
- [guide_use](https://github.com/aynsleybernard/ethical-ai/blob/main/case-study/guide_use.ipynb): guide use, including any challenges or successes encountered  
- [lessons.md](https://github.com/aynsleybernard/ethical-ai/blob/main/case-study/lessons.md): lessons learned and future plans for the use of the guide
