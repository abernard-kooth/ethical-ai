# Ethical and Responsible Innovation Guide: Case Study
This repository contains a case study utilising a guide for the responsible design and implementation of AI systems in the public sector, by The Alan Turing Institute's Public Policy Programme.  

## Background
The Alan Turing Institute is a national research institute for data science and artificial intelligence. As the field of AI and data science continues to grow and impact society in new ways, it is important for researchers and practitioners to consider the ethical implications of their work.  

To address this need, the Institute developed a document to provide guidance on ethical considerations for AI and data science innovation. The guide covers a range of topics, including fairness, transparency, accountability, and more.  

## Case Study
The case study in this repository documents the process of developing the ethical and responsible innovation guide at the Institute. It covers the following topics:
- Who this guide is for and why
- The context in which the guide was used  
- The process of using the guide, including any challenges or successes encountered  
- The impact of using the guide on research and practices  
- Lessons learned and future plans for the use of the guide
